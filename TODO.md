# Task: Fix Education History Section Not Showing on Application Review Page

## Completed Steps ✅

### 1. Issue Analysis

- ✅ Identified that education section was conditionally rendered based on `applicationNotes.education`
- ✅ Found that `parseApplicationNotes` function had restrictive regex pattern
- ✅ Located the issue in `src/lib/organizationService.js`

### 2. Root Cause

- ✅ The regex pattern `/Education: (.?) - (.?) \((.*?)\)/` was too restrictive
- ✅ Pattern only matched single characters for institution and degree fields
- ✅ This prevented proper parsing of multi-word education data

### 3. Fix Implementation

- ✅ Updated regex pattern to `/Education:\s*([^-\n]+?)\s*-\s*([^-\n]+?)\s*\(([^)]+)\)/`
- ✅ New pattern allows multi-word institution names and degrees
- ✅ Improved whitespace handling with `\s*` patterns

### 4. Testing Status

- ⏳ **Ready for testing** - The fix has been implemented
- ⏳ **Next step**: Test the application review page to verify education section displays correctly

## Expected Result

The education history section should now properly display on the application review page when education data is present in the application notes, showing:

- Institution name
- Degree/course of study
- Current year of study

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/organizationService.js` - Fixed regex pattern in `parseApplicationNotes` function
